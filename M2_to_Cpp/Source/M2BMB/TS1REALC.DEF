(* -------------------------------------------------------------------
    This module is internally needed by the implementation of BMB
    Cross Platform 'Fmt' module. It contains operations for conversion
    of real numbers. Operations are characteristic for internal
    representation of real numbers of Top Speed Modula-2 ver. 1.x,
    or 80x86/MS-DOS platform in general.

    These operations are extracted from Top Speed's module Str.
    Some of them are slighly changed to include overflow detection
    and to better conform to BMB Conformance tests.
