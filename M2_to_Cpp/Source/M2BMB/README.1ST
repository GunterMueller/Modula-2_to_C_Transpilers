This is a slightly modified version of the BMB Modula-2 Cross-Platform
Library v1.1, getting rid of runtime check errors some modules (String) cause,
and makeing it more compatible with TopSpeed Modula-2 v3.

Changes are:
  - module String taken from v1.0, with added procedures SubString and Insert
    and modified Delete and Slice, to conform to v1.1
  - in ENV.DEF all references to AsmLib changed to Lib for TS 3 compatibility
  - in ENV.MOD 65535 changed to 65534 for TS 3 compatibility
