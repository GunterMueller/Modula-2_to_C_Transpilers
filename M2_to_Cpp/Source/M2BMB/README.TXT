Basics
------

The BMB Modula-2 Cross-Platform Library is a set of 'standard'
Modula-2 modules, which can be used instaed of specific
modules of your favourite Modula-2 implementation. If you use
this library, your programs should be easily portable to every
platform where BMB Cross-Platform Library is implemented.

All modules are available in source code and can be used
without any restrictions. It would be nice however to mention
the library and its authors in any text describing your
program (if it uses the library).
