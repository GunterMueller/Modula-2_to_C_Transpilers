M2 Cross Compiler
=================

M2 is a cross compiler from the M2 programming language to the C
programming language. The syntax of M2 is inspired by Modula 2, which
in tourn is based on Pascal. Both are due to prof. Niklaus Wirth.

The project of M2 started in 2002 intended to become a sorta of "strong
typed scripting language".

Then, who should be interested in using M2? Peoples that likes languages
like Pascal and Modula should find again the pleasure of a clean
programming language. Novices should find in M2 good tool to explore
the concepts of algorithms and data structures, without the complexity
of other programming languages.
