This directory contains configuration files depended from object machine
and used C compiler. These files named as CPU-COMPILER.h (e.g. vax-gcc.h).

The directory also contains assembler files which implements Modula-2
coroutines. These files named as CPU-corout.c (e.g. vax-corout.c) If the
corresponding file does not exist the Modula-2 coroutines will not work
on given machine.

Auxiliary files in this directory may be used for creation of new
configuration files. File common_part.h contains common part of all
configuration files for tunning Modula-2 translator. Files named as CPU.h
describe common information about all C compiler on given machine. Files
named as COMPILER.h describe common information about given compiler on
all machines.
