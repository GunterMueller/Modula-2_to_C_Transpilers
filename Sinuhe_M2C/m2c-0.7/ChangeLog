Changes since 0.6 are noted in the git log at sv.gnu.org/projects/m2c/

Sun Oct 26 15:01:11 1997  Vladimir N. Makarov  <vladimir@localhost>

	* New version 0.6 was fixed. The version for is 64-bit
 	  architectures too.

Fri Dec  9 21:33:34 1994  Vladimir Makarov  <vladimir@darkstar>

	* New version 0.5 was fixed.  Install means preliminary uninstall
	in `Makefile.tmpl'.  Some unsignificant changes in
	`m2-type-size.c'.

Wed Jun 30 03:52:36 1993  Vladimir  (vladimir@hwruss1)

	* File m2-generator.c was changed.  Function generate_call did not
	test that pointer type of argument of a type transfer function is
	represented by C structure and as consequence code of access to
	the structure member was not generated.  Function
	generate_statement increase variable
	current_level_of_nesting_with_statements in incorrect place.
	Therefore invalid code was generated for nested with statements
	when designator after keyword `with' in a nested with-statement is
	a field of structure in a covered with statement.

	* New version 0.4 was fixed.  This version permits main module and
	implementation module have the same suffix.  Now implementation
	module is determined by its suffix and its source file contest
	(by the first keyword of source file).  To make this a new regime of
	syntax analyzer is added.  The analyzer in the regime determine
	that given source file is a main module.  Also an implementation
	module may be processed twice if corresponding definition file has
	not been not processed yet.  In this case processing the
	implementation file is finished after reading the first keyword
	and after that corresponding definition module is processed and
	processing the implementation module is repeated.  Also suffixes
	of module files are changed (only `.mod' for implementation and
	main modules and `.def' for definition module).  Therefore all
	files with suffix `.imp' (in this directory, in the
	sub-directories `m2-examples', `m2-tests') were renamed and file
	m2c.1, config/common_part.h and Makefile.tmpl were changed.  The
        main differences of new version are follows:
	  1. New global variables testing_main_module and it_is_main
	  module are defined.  The first variable instructs the new regime
	  of the analyzer.  The second contains result of test in the new
	  regime.  Therefore files `m2-main.c' and `m2-common.h' were
	  changed.
          2. New function test_main_module which tests that command line
	  parameter is a main module file is added into file `m2-main.c'.
          3. Function modula_analyzer in file `m2-main.c' has now only two
	  arguments (file name suffix parameter was deleted).
	  4. Function icode_and_analyze_declaration in file `m2-main.c'
	  has new argument which is error message used when module file is
	  not opened.  The function also returns result which instructs
	  that given file must be repeatedly processed (after processing
	  corresponding definition module file).
	  5. Function compilation_unit in file `m2-syntax.c' now returns
          result which instructs that given file must be repeatedly
          processed (after processing corresponding definition module
          file).  Therefore also file `m2-syntax.h' was changed.

	* New version 0.3 was fixed.  The main differences:
	  1. File m2-scanner.c, function next_file_symbol.  The error was
	  fixed.  This error resulted in invalid counting line number when
	  last star in source line was processed in commentary.
	  2. File m2-syntax.c, function
	  create_and_include_declaration_node.  The function have
	  additional parameter module_exporter.  This parameter is needed
	  because now the function does not fixed (as in early)
	  repeated import and export of the same entity as an error.
	     File m2-syntax.c, function field_list_sequence.  Early the
	  error in declaration of record field or empty field list
	  sequence resulted in abort.  These errors were fixed.
	  3. File m2-semantics.c, function discrete_less_then_operation.
	  The function can process NULL parameters now.  Early the error
	  in range construction resulted in abort in this function.
	     Function current_procedure_error and static variable
	  current_procedure_name are deleted.  Because the processing
	  errors with the aid of the function resulted in invalid
	  procedure name in the message of `m2c' when the error was fixed
	  for the procedure which had another function call as actual
	  parameter.
	    Function process_call was modified.  Early Modula-2 procedures
	  INC and DEC processed only restrictive parameters types.  Now
	  these procedure process parameters accordingly to Modula-2
	  report (including parameters of type ADDRESS).
	  4. File m2-generator.c, function generate_call.  Added code for
	  generation of type casting when parameters of type ADDRESS are
	  processed for procedures DEC and INC.  Also code was added to
	  generate type casting when formal parameter WORD or BYTE
	  (without ARRAY OF) or when actual parameter ADDRESS.  The recent
	  casting is processed by new function
	  output_type_definition_part_through_struct_pointer which is
	  analogous to function output_type_definition_part.  Also this
	  new function is used to generate type casting in assignment
	  implementing return from procedure-function.
	    Function generate_statement.  The error was fixed for
          processing case-statement.  Because of absence of additional
	  brackets `{}' and nested if-else-statements the generation of
	  some case labels did not occur.  Now new function
	  output_type_definition_part_through_struct_pointer is used to
	  generate type casting in assignment statement.
	    Function generate_block now does not generate declaration of
          extern function exit because this resulted in generation of
	  warning by some C compilers.
	  5. Other changes are only spelling and formatting.

	* New version 0.2 was fixed. The main differences:
           1. Bug was fixed in function process_expression of file
	   m2-generator.c. The function did not process case when argument
	   expr is NULL. As a consequence the translator was aborted on
	   some machine and programs when flag `-all' was in command line.

	   2. The translator generated invalid code for the case of casts
	   INTEGER(constant), CARDINAL(constant) because constant was
	   sometimes considered as of type SHORTINT or SHORTCARD (i.e. it
	   is considered that the constant size is 2 bytes). This resulted
	   in error work of some programs (e.g. PowersOf2.mod) on machines
	   with byte arrangement in a word analogous to Data General
	   Aviion. Therefore needed code was added to function
	   generate_call in file m2-generator.c.

	   3. Files m2-semantics.c and doc/modula-2.texinfo were slightly
	   corrected.

Tue Jun  9 12:17:32 1992  Makaroff V.N.  (mak at vmunix)

	* Version 0.1 is cardinally different from version 0.0 (e.g.
the most of variable names are changed).  Therefore it is meaningless
to write all changes here.

Fri Dec 20 14:43:31 1991  Makaroff V.N.  (mak at vmunix_ra2)

	* root of GNU Modula-2 translator.
