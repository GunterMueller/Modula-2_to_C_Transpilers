This is the Modula-2 translator, by Vladimir Makarov. The translator
is based on the language report in the 4th edition of Wirth's book
Programming in Modula-2. The translator also supports the third edition of
this book. High portability of the translator is achieved by intermediate
translation into C. The translator is aimed for use on POSIX systems.

The configure generated Makefile understands the variables bindir,
libdir, man1dir, and prefix. Use only the full path name for directories.

           make install prefix=/usr/users/VHDL/mak
     
                           or

           make install bindir=/usr/users/VHDL/mak/bin\
                libdir=/usr/users/VHDL/mak/lib\
                /usr/users/VHDL/mak/man/man1

To specify where to find the sources, as an argument +srcdir to
configure:

          ../m2c-0.7/configure +srcdir=../m2c-0.7

You can use option `+cc' if you wish that configure will not ask
about C compiler name. For example:

      configure +cc=gcc
